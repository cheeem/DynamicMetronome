## Dynamic Metronome

[Visit the Website](https://dynamic-metronome.netlify.app/)

The **Dynamic Metronome** gives the users the ability to change the **tempo**, **types of notes** and **sounds** played to create a **customized musical experience**. The layout and design of the Metronome is built around accompanying the auditory experience with a **visual** one, with an **easy-to-use**, **accessibile** model being the **focus** of the design.

This project is **not** finished, and I please ask that if you have any recommendations for how I could improve the application that you **leave a message**. Thank you so much! <3
